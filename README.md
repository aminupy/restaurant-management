# restaurant-management

This is a legendary 700-line C++ project I made in my **first semester** of Computer Engineering,  
for the course **Fundamentals of Programming**.

It "manages" a restaurant (kind of) â€” lets you sell food, or at least pretend to.

I thought I lost it forever... but then I found it in my Telegram saved messages. What a plot twist!

No extra libraries, no `.gitignore`, no license, and definitely no best practices â€”  
because back then, I didnâ€™t even know what those things were ðŸ˜„

Kept it exactly the way it was â€” for the nostalgia!
