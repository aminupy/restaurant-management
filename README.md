# restaurant-management

This is a legendary 700-line C++ project I made in my **first semester** of Computer Engineering,  
for the course **Fundamentals of Programming**.

It "manages" a restaurant (kind of) — lets you sell food, or at least pretend to.

I thought I lost it forever... but then after years I found it in my Telegram saved messages. I think I had uploaded it there for a checkpoint backup, and I don't know if it's the latest and complete version that I presented or not! 😂


No extra libraries, no `.gitignore`, no license, and definitely no best practices —  
because back then, I didn’t even know what those things were 😄

Kept it exactly the way it was — for the nostalgia!
